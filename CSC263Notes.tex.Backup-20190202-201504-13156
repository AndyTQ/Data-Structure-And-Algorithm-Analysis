    \textbf{Why do we need to learn data structures? }This course helps you to explore a new perspective on the algorithm analysis, in the field of Computer Science. CSC263 will also provide you the foundation of technical interviews from your dream tech companies, such as Microsoft, Google, etc. This lecture notes will primarily follow Prof. Sam Toueg's lecture, Prof. David Liu's lecture notes, as well as CLRS. According to Prof. Sam Toueg's description of the course: \quote{Data structures are ways of organizing the data involved in computation, suitable for representation in and manipulation by computers. Algorithms are precisely stated, general problem solving methods. Data structures and algorithms are central to computer science. They are also integrally related: neither can be studied fruitfully without knowledge of the other. This course has two goals: First, to learn several important data structures and algorithms, including how to choose and/or modify a data structure to solve various problems; and second, to introduce the basic tools and techniques for the analysis of algorithms and data structures.}

\section{Review of Growth of Functions}
\subsection{Asymptotic bounds on worst-case time complexity}
\includegraphics{image001.png}
Let $t(x)$ be the number of steps taken by algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ on the input $x$.\\
Let $T(n)$ be the $worst-case$ time complexity of algorithm $\mathcal{A}$.
Then:
\begin{center}$T(n) = \max_{\textbf{all inputs $x$ of size $n$}} t(x) = \max\{t(x) : x \text{ is an input of size }n\}$\end{center}
\textbf{To prove that $T(n)$ is $O(g(n))$}, we must show that:\\
$$\exists c >\ 0, \exists n_0 > 0, \forall n > n_0 : T(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$$
The above statement is equivalent to: \\
$\Leftrightarrow$ max \{$t(x) : $ $x$ is an input of size $n$\} $\leq$ $c \cdot g(n)$ 
\\
$\Leftrightarrow$ For \textbf{every} input $x$ of size $n$, $t(x) \leq c \cdot g(n)$
\\
$\Leftrightarrow$ For \textbf{every} input of size $n$, $\mathcal{A}$ takes \textit{\textbf{at most}} $c \cdot g(n)$ steps.
\textbf{\\ To prove that $T(n)$ is $\Omega(g(n))$}, we must show that: 
$$\exists c >\ 0, \exists n_0 > 0, \forall n > n_0 : T(n) \geq c \cdot g(n)$$
The above statement is equivalent to: \\
$\Leftrightarrow$ max \{$t(x) : $ $x$ is an input of size $n$\} $\geq$ $c \cdot g(n)$ 
\\
$\Leftrightarrow$ For \textbf{some} input $x$ of size $n$, $t(x) \geq c \cdot g(n)$
\\
$\Leftrightarrow$ For \textbf{some} input of size $n$, $\mathcal{A}$ takes \textit{\textbf{at least}} $c \cdot g(n)$ steps.
\textbf{\\ To prove that $T(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n)),$} we must show that:
$$\text{$T(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ \textbf{and} $T(n)$ is $\Omega{(g(n))}$}$$
For example, the worst-case time complexity for bubble sort is $\Theta(n^2)$. This means that bubble sort is both $O(n^2)$ and $\Omega(n^2)$. Since bubble sort is $O(n^2)$, for \textbf{every} input of size n, the algorithm takes\textit{ \textbf{at most}} $c_1 \cdot n^2$ steps. Since bubble sort is $\Theta(n^2)$, this means that for \textbf{some} in put of size n, the algorithm takes \textbf{\textit{at least}} $c_2 \cdot n^2$ steps.
\section{Priority Queues \& Heaps}
\subsection{Abstract Data Type (ADT) vs. Data Structure}
Before we start talking about any else, let us discuss about the definition of \textbf{abstract data type} and \textbf{data structure}.\begin{quotation} \noindent An \textbf{abstract data type (ADT)} is a theoretical model of an entity and the set of operations that can be performed on that entity. In other words, it {describes an object and its operations.}\\ \noindent A \textbf{data structure} is {some specific implementation of Abstract Data Type.}\end{quotation}\\
\subsection{The Priority Queue ADT}
Consider the following example, which is the definition for the Priority Quete ADT.
\begin{framed}
\textbf{The Priority Queue ADT}\\
\indent Object: Set S of elements with ``keys'' (priority) that can be compared
\\
\indent Operations: \\
\indent \indent \textbullet \indent \textbf{Insert(S, x): }Insert element x into S.
\\
\indent \indent \textbullet \indent \textbf{Max(S): } Returns the element with the highest priority (i.e. largest key) in S.
\\
\indent \indent \textbullet \indent \textbf{Extract\_Max(S, x): } Returns Max(S) and removes it from S.
\end{framed}
A classic example of priority queues in practice is a hospital waiting
room: more severe injuries and illnesses are generally treated before minor
ones, regardless of when the patients arrived at the hospital.\footnote{Liu, n.d., 23}
\subsection{Heaps}
\begin{flushleft}Our goal is to do all the operations above in $\Theta(log(n))$ time. The solution is to use a \textbf{data structure} called \textbf{Max-Heap}. \end{flushleft}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Worst Case Time For   & Insert & Extract\_Max \\ \hline
Unordered Linked List & $\Theta(1)$      &  $\Theta(n)$            \\ \hline
Ordered Linked List   &  $\Theta(n)$      &  $\Theta(1)$            \\ \hline
\textbf{Max Heap}     &  $\Theta(log(n))$ & $\Theta(log(n))$       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Before introducing the max-heap, let us talk about the complete binary tree. A \textbf{complete binary tree (CBT)} is a binary tree such that, for every level $L$ (except the bottom level), the binary tree has $2^L$ nodes. Also, all the nodes at the bottom level are as far left as possible.
\newpage
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image004.png}\end{center}
  \caption{An example of \textbf{non-complete} binary tree}
  \begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{image005.png}\end{center}
  \caption{An example of \textbf{complete} binary tree}
 \end{figure}
\begin{center}\fbox{Fact: Height of a CBT with n nodes is $\lfloor log_2(n)\rfloor$}
\end{center}
A \textbf{max-heap} is a complete binary tree that satisfies \textbf{max-heap property}, which is that the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
We typically use an \textbf{array} to store a max-heap into the memory.
\begin{figure}[h]\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{image006.png}\end{center}\caption{The order of elements in an array implementation of a max-heap.}
\end{figure}
\\
Notice from the figure that the array is just the \textbf{level-order traversal} of the max-heap, from \textbf{top \textbf{to bottom}}.
\begin{figure}[h]\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{image007.png}\end{center}\caption{A typical example of array representation of a Max-Heap.}\end{figure}
Now let us introduce the operations for the max-heap. \\
\begin{framed}
\textbf{High level idea for operations on Max-Heap}\\
\indent \textbullet  \indent Maintain the Complete Binary Tree shape.\\
\indent \textbullet \indent Maintain the Max-Heap property. 
\end{framed}
\\
\textbf{Insert(S, x): }Insert places a key in a new node that is the last node in a level-order-traversal of the heap. The inserted key is then “``bubbled'' upwards until the heap property is satisfied.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The algorithm for insert operation of max-heap.}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Insert}{$A, x$}
\State Put $x$ at the bottom left of the tree:
\State Increment A.heapsize and and set A[A.heapsize] = $x$
\State Bubble $x$ up to the top of the tree:
\While{$x$ is not root \textbf{AND} priority of $x > $ priority of its parent}
\State Swap $x$ with its parent
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\\
Putting $x$ at the bottom left of the tree \textbf{maintains Complete Binary Tree shape}, and bubbling $x$ up to the top of the tree \textbf{maintains the Max-Heap property.} Since the max-heap is a CBT with height $\lfloor log_2(n)\rfloor$, bubbling $x$ up the tree takes is $O(log(n))$. Thus, the worst case running time of the algorithm is $O(log(n))$.\\
\textbf{Max(S)}: We simply get the root of the tree. Thus, the Max algorithm is constant runtime. \\
\textbf{Extract\_Max(S, x): }
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The algorithm for extract-max operation of max-heap.}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Extract\_Max}{$A, x$}
\State Return the root A[1].
\State Remove the returned element from the heap: 
\State \indent Set A[1] = A[A.heapsize] and decrement A.heapsize
\State Drip the element in A[1] down the tree:
\State \indent Let $x$ be the element in A[1]\While{$x$ is not a leaf \textbf{AND} priority of some child of $x > $priority of $x$}
\State Swap $x$ with the highest-priority of child of $x$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsection{Mergeable Priority Queue ADT and Binomial Heaps}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Abstract Data Types      & Data Structures   & Insert & Min & Extract\_Min & Union \\ \hline
Priority Queues          & Min Heap          &    Yes    &  Yes   & Yes             &   \textbf{No}    \\ \hline
\textbf{Mergable} Priority Queues & Min \textbf{Binomial} Heaps &   Yes     &   Yes  & Yes             &   \textbf{Yes}    \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\\
Elements of binomial heaps are stored in a \textbf{sequence} of \textbf{binomial trees}. (i.e. Binomial Forests)
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{image008.png}\end{center}
\caption{A visualization of binomial tree,  $B_4$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{image009.png}\end{center}
\caption{A more general visualization of binomial tree,  $B_k$.}
\end{figure}
\\
\begin{framed}
\textbf{Properties of Binomial Tree, $B_k$: }
\begin{itemize}
  \item Height $k$
  \item $2^k$ nodes
  \item $\binom{k}{d}$ nodes at depth $d$
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}
A \textbf{Binomial Forest} is a sequence of $B_k$ trees with strictly decreasing k’'s and a total of n nodes.
\begin{framed}
\textbf{Binomial Forest $F_n$: }
\begin{itemize}
\item $F_n$ has $n$ nodes.
\item $n =\  <b_t,b_{t-1},...,b_0>_2.$ Note that $t = \lfloor log_2(n) \rfloor$
\item $F_n =\ <\text{all trees $B_i$ such that bit $b_i = 1$}>$
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}
\noindent
\textbf{Implementation of operations on Binomial Heaps}\\
\textbf{Union(T, Q): }$S \gets Union (T, Q)$: Think about binary addition. Additional info about this to be appeared later.  \\
\textbf{To analyze the worst-case time complexity of Union: }
Let $|T| \leq n$ and $|Q| \leq n$ (i.e. each contains at most n elements). This implies that each of T, Q have $O(log(n))$ $B_k$ trees. Then Union(T,Q) takes at most $O(log(n))$ key-comparisions. Hence the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is $O(log(n))$. 
\textbf{\\ Insert(T, x): }Simply apply this statement: $S \gets Union (T, x)$
\\
\textbf{Min(T):} Scan the roots of the $B_k$ trees of $T$ and return the smallest key.\\
\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Extract\_Min(T)}:
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The algorithm for Extract\_Min for binomial min heap.}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Extract\_Min}{$T$}
\State // Do Min(T) to locate the smallest element
\State $U \gets T - B_i$
\State // Delete root of $B_i$. By lemma 2, we get a binomial heap $S$, where:
\State $S \gets B_i - \text{root of $B_i$}$
\State $T \gets Union(U,S)$
\end{algorithmic}
